# We currently have two images available to us as we move towards https://github.com/giantswarm/roadmap/issues/1640
# This will change when we have changes in our fork merged back upstream.
# We have to support two images for now because the kiam-agent "vintage" clusters on older release versions (< v18.1.0) doesn't allow
# for the network calls in changes made and this causes the deployment to fail.
